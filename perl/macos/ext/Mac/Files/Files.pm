=item kCreateFolder

=item kDontCreateFolder

Constants for Folder Manager.

sub kOnSystemDisk			() { 0x8000 }
sub kCreateFolder			() {      1 }
sub kDontCreateFolder			() {      0 }

=item kALMLocationsFolderType

Specifies the Locations folder in the Location Manager Prefs folder. Files containing configuration information for different locations are stored here. Supported with S<Mac OS> 8.1 and later.

=cut

sub kALMLocationsFolderType		() { 'fall' }

=item kALMModulesFolderType

Specifies the Location Manager Modules folder in the Extensions Folder. Supported with S<Mac OS> 8.1 and later.

=cut

sub kALMModulesFolderType		() { 'walk' }

=item kALMPreferencesFolderType

=item kApplicationSupportFolderType

Specifies the Application Support folder in the System Folder. This folder contains code and data files needed by third-party applications. These files should usually not be written to after they are installed. In general, files deleted from this folder remove functionality from an application, unlike files in the Preferences folder, which should be non-essential. One type of file that could be placed here would be plug-ins that the user might want to maintain separately from any application, such as for an image-processing application that has many "fourth-party" plug-ins that the user might want to upgrade separately from the host application. Another type of file that might belong in this folder would be application-specific data files that are not preferences, such as for a scanner application that needs to read description files for specific scanner models according to which are currently available on the SCSI bus or network.
