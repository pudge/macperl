* Fix AEDesc->data bug, remove debugging code (oops)

* Refactor Makefile.PLs
  - use common.pl for Makefile.PLs to share
  - now use distributed xsubpp (brian d foy) instead of system xsubpp
  - $module.c files no longer included
  - auto-generate $module.pod (and manpages) from POD in $module.pm
    and $module.xs

* Fix POD in many places

* Require 5.006 in the base Makefile.PL (just in case)

* Make build work with gcc2 on Mac OS X 10.1 and 10.2

* Make build work with UFS
