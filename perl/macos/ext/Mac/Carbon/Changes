* v0.04, 6 March 2003

   Make AppleEvents with LD=c++ (required for Dec 2002 Dev Tools)

   Added a bunch of Carbon-specific constants for Mac::Files

   Modified Mac::Speech (Peter N Lewis)
     - GetVoiceDesciption and NewSpeechChannel use default voice
       if no parameter given
     - %Voice hash returns default voice if key is false (undef, '', 0)
     - Added accessor methods for VoiceDescription and VoiceSpec structures

   Added Str63 type to typemap

   Cleaned up distribution a little


* v0.03, 17 December 2002

   Fix AEDesc->data bug, remove debugging code (oops)

   Refactor Makefile.PLs
     - use common.pl for Makefile.PLs to share
     - now use distributed xsubpp (brian d foy) instead of system xsubpp
     - $module.c files no longer included
     - auto-generate $module.pod (and manpages) from POD in $module.pm
       and $module.xs

   Fix POD in many places

   Require 5.006 in the base Makefile.PL (just in case)

   Make build work with gcc2 on Mac OS X 10.1 and 10.2

   Make build work with UFS
