=head1 NAME

macperldelta - what is new for MacPerl v5.8.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.6.1 release
and the 5.8.0 release.

This document covers changes specific to MacPerl.  For general changes
to perl, you might also want to read L<perl5005delta> for changes
between 5.004 and 5.005, L<perl56delta> for changes from 5.005
to 5.6, and L<perldelta> for changes from 5.6 to present.

For changes from MacPerl 5.2.0r4 to 5.6.1, see L<macperl56delta>.

=head1 Highlights In MacPerl 5.8.0

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Shared Libraries Incompatible

This is mentioned elsewhere in the perl documentation but bears repeating
here: shared libraries made for use with perl 5.004 (and MacPerl 5.2.0r4)
or perl 5.6 (and MacPerl 5.6.1) are not supported for use with perl 5.8
(and MacPerl 5.8).

The MacPerl Module Porters page has been updated to note whether a
particular distribution is for 5.004, 5.6, or 5.8.

	http://dev.macperl.org/mmp

B<Note>: With cpan-mac it was recommended that F<site_perl> be added
to the Libraries preferences, so that its modules would override the
ones that came with MacPerl.  If you keep your old F<site_perl>,
MacPerl will fail.  Either clean it out, or remove it from the
Libraries preferences.


=head2 See macperl56delta

There are other important incompatible changes with MacPerl 5.8 and
MacPerl 5.2.0r4 that are mentioned in L<macperl56delta>.


=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Update to 5.8 sources

=over 4

=item *

See the relevant perl core documentation for what all this means,
but of particular interest note that MacPerl now has extensive
support for Unicode and alternate character sets.

=back

See F<README.macos> in the perl source and L<http://dev.macperl.org/>
for more information about the sources.


=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Bundled Modules

The modules below are, in addition to the Mac:: modules and the
Perl standard library, included with the MacPerl distribution.
They are included because they are basic functionality needed for
using CPAN and installing other modules, or have general utility.

Many extra modules included with MacPerl 5.6 are now part
of the standard distribution, and so are still included but are
not listed here.

The modules are listed with their version number, and followed
by any bugs or behavior differences.

=item Convert::BinHex 1.119

=item File::Sort 1.00

file:foo.txt != file:./foo.txt in heuristics.t.

=head2 Updated And Improved Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

Some of the Mac:: modules have minor bugfixes.

=item *

ExtUtils::MM_MacOS has undergone some overhaul, as MakeMaker
has been reworked.

=back


=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

There have been more fixes to make @INC and lib.pm smarter about
accepting Unix-like and Mac-like paths.

=back


=head1 Known Problems

=over 4

=item *

C<system> doesn't return a good value, and C<$?> is fairly useless.

=item *

The version of sfio we use has problems with the C<%g> and C<%f>
C<sprintf> formats.  C<"%.0f", 0.6> should give C<1>, but gives C<0>.
C<%g> should pad with zeroes, but pads with spaces.

=item *

C<sysread> should warn when passed a filehandle opened for read-only,
but does not.

=item *

taint mode thing

=item *

alarm stuff

=item *

C<%ENV> is not as magical as, or more magical than, you might want it to be.
Among other problems, C<%ENV = ()> does not clear out C<%ENV>, and the environment
does not carry over to C<system> calls.

=item *

There is no support for the Encode module or the Mac::
toolbox modules in the 68K builds.  This may change.

=item *

There is no support for PPC sockets
in the Socket module.  This may change.

=item *

Currently, the MPW perl binary created with the MrC compiler will crash
MPW after it loads shared libraries.  However, shared libraries built with
MrC can be used with the standard binaries, or by other binaries created
with the MWCPPC compiler, with no ill effects.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
macperl@perl.org mailing list (http://lists.perl.org/)
and the MacPerl bug database (http://dev.macperl.org/).

If you believe you have an unreported bug in MacPerl, please
go to the MacPerl bug database.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  If running the MPW tool,
include the output of C<perl -V>.  If running the application,
run the "One Liner" MacPerl script, and execute the text
C<perl -V>.

Also please include the model of your computer and version of your
operating system in the bug report (e.g., "PowerBook G3/400 running
Mac OS 9.2.2"), as well as any additional information that might
be useful.  If there is a system crash or odd system behavior,
consider attaching a report from Apple System Profiler, included
with most recent versions of Mac OS.
