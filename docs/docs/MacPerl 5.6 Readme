=head1 NAME

MacPerl Readme

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Welcome to MacPerl, the application that implements perl,
the programming language and environment, on Mac OS (Classic).
If you are running perl under Mac OS X, you don't want to be here
(unless you are in the Classic environment under Mac OS X).


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Please read the READMEs that come with MacPerl, but ignore the
installation instructions presented in the main README; they do not
apply to the Mac OS port of perl.

Read L<macperldelta> for changes since MacPerl 5.2.0r4.

=head2 System Requirements

MacPerl 5.6 requires Mac OS 8.1 or above, either 68040 or PowerPC,
and 12MB RAM.  64MB or more RAM is recommended for using certain
modules and programs.

CarbonLib 1.0.4 or greater is also required.  Mac OS 8.1 also
requires the Navigation extension, included with CarbonLib 1.0.4.
All versions of CarbonLib may be downloaded from Apple for free.

  English-North_American/Macintosh/System/Other_System/>

 <URL:http://www.info.apple.com/support/downloads.html>

You may also wish to increase MacPerl's memory allocation to as much
as 30MB, 60MB, or more, depending on what you're using it for.

For using just the MPW tool, Mac OS 7.5.5 and 68030 should be sufficient,
though some of the Mac:: modules might not work.


=head2 Distribution

MacPerl can always be obtained from the following locations, among
others:

	http://dev.macperl.org/
	http://www.cpan.org/ports/mac/
	ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/ports/mac/

MacPerl is avaiable on all the CPAN sites.  Find the CPAN mirror near you:

	http://mirror.cpan.org/

MacPerl is distributed in two forms: a web installer (about 400K) and
a full installer (around 20MB).  The web installer is recommended,
as it only downloads the components you need.


   MacPerl-5.6.1r2_web.bin
   MacPerl-5.6.1r2_full.bin
           ^    ^^ ^    ^
           |    || |    MacBinary Suffix ("bin")
           |    || Distribution Component (web", "full")
           |    |Build Number ("1")
           |    Type ("d"evelopment, "a"lpha, "b"eta, "r"elease)
           Perl Version ("5.6.1")


Both the web and full installers are self-updating as new versions
of MacPerl are released; they will fetch and install only changed
files, so you don't need to download everything anew.

B<Note>: Some beta versions of the full installer were not
self-updating; please download a new installer.


=head2 Installing

MacPerl is installed by running the installer, selecting an
option, and then setting up the Online Help as described below.

To install the MPW perl tool, additionally follow the instructions
in F<Install.MPW_Perl>.

The following installation options are available:

=over 4

=item Easy Install / Basic Install

This installs the application (for your platform), the
documentation, and the library.  This will be the option
for most users.

=item MPW Tool

This installs the MPW tool (for your platform), a command-line
version of perl for use with ToolServer and Macintosh Programmer's
Workshop.  When selected, the documentation and library will be
selected as well, by default.

=item Developer Kit

This installs all the source, and the SYM files for debugging.
Most users will not want or need these files.

=back


=head2 Online Help

There are two portions to the MacPerl documentation.  The first
is this README, along with the rest of the READMEs, licenses, and
manuals in the MacPerl F<Documentation> directory.

The other is the considerable amount of POD-based online help
that comes with Perl.  For this help to work, make sure you have:

=over 4

=item *

F<MacPerl Help>, the F<pod> folder, the F<lib> folder, and F<Shuck>
in the same folder as your MacPerl application.

=item *

A recent version of Internet Config, or the Internet control panel
shipped with recent versions of Mac OS.  Internet Config is available
in many places online, and at:

	ftp://ftp.stairways.com/other/internetconfig-202.sit

=item *

Set up Internet Config (or the Internet control panel) with a helper
for "http", set to your web browser of choice, and a helper for
"pod", set to F<Shuck>, the POD reader distributed with MacPerl.

=back

Once it is set up, open Shuck and look under the "Go" menu, or
MacPerl under the "Help" menu, and select various documentation
pages (including Various->macperlbook for information on the
MacPerl book).

To look up information on specific words in Shuck, select
Go->LookupÉ.  In MacPerl, highlight a word and select
Help->Perl Help or double-click it.


=head2 Mac::Glue

L<Mac::Glue> is a special framework for using Apple events with an
AppleScript vocabulary, but Perl syntax.  Run the F<gluedialect>
and F<gluescriptadds> droplets, drop any application (including
the Finder) that you wish to be able to script onto F<gluemac>,
and read the L<Mac::Glue> documentation.


=head2 Mailing list

There are several MacPerl mailing lists covering various aspects of
MacPerl.  See the Perl mailing lists site for more information.

	http://lists.perl.org/


=head2 Building

The perl 5.6.1 source itself builds on Mac OS, with some additional
pieces.  Support for Mac OS is now in the perl core, and MacPerl is
kept in close sync with regular perl releases.

You will need compilers and libraries, all of them freely
available.  These are linked to from the development site at
L<http://dev.macperl.org/>. Go to that site for all things having to
do with MacPerl development.


=head1 CONTACT

Please send your bug reports, patches, and feature requests for MacPerl
to the MacPerl development site at L<http://dev.macperl.org/>.  Also head
over there for the latest source and links to other sites.
