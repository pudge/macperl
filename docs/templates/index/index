Welcome to the home of MacPerl development.  MacPerl,
the Mac OS port of Larry Wall's programming language
<a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> is available
as both a standalone application, and as an
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/">MPW</a> tool.
It was written by <a href="http://www.iis.ee.ethz.ch/~neeri/">Matthias
Neeracher</a>, and is currently maintained by <a
href="http://pudge.net/">Chris Nandor</a>.
</p>


<h2>Current Release</h2>

<p>
MacPerl 5.6 is in development (beta).
The current release of MacPerl is
<a href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7940&amp;release_id=20742">5.2.0r4</a>
(1998.04.17), based on perl 5.004.
The current development release is
<a href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7940&amp;release_id=68835">5.6.1b3</a>
(2002.01.07), based on perl 5.6.1, which is the most recent release of perl.  MacPerl is also being
ported to perl 5.8.0, which is currently in development.  No releases of that are expected until
MacPerl 5.6.1 is released.
</p>


<h2>MacPerl Development</h2>

<p>
Please read the <a href="/state.txt">State of MacPerl Message</a> for
an overview of what is going on, and see
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~pudge/">Chris Nandor's
use Perl page</a> for his journal of development.  If you would like
to build MacPerl yourself, please read the
<a href="/?build">Build Instructions</a>.  If you feel like it,
please report what happened (for building and using)
on our <a href="/cgi-bin/mp-report">Testing</a> page.  See much of what
is going on over at the
<a href="http://sf.net/projects/macperl/">MacPerl SourceForge.net</a>
site.
</p>

<p>
The source for MacPerl is available via anonymous CVS, and is also
available on the main perl repository in the <tt>maint-5.6/macperl</tt> branch.
</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>
For questions about MacPerl, use the <a href="http://lists.perl.org/">MacPerl
mailing lists</a> (also available on nntp.perl.org or another NNTP
server near you). For bug reports,
use the <a href="http://sf.net/tracker/?group_id=7940&amp;atid=107940">MacPerl bugs</a>
page.  When you <a href="http://sf.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=7940&amp;atid=107940">submit
bug reports</a>, please be very clear about what version/revision of MacPerl
(or other files/programs/modules) you are using.
</p>

<p>
Please direct <em>general</em> Perl questions and bug reports -- questions
and bug reports not specific to MacPerl, but to Perl in general -- not to the MacPerl
places, but to the appropriate places for Perl itself.
</p>


<h2>Mac OS X</h2>

<p>
MacPerl runs under the Classic environment on Mac OS X.  There are currently no
plans to port it to Carbon.  Unix perl runs just fine under Mac OS X.  It would
be nice to, at some point, have the Toolbox modules (Mac::Windows, Mac::Events)
Carbonized so the same GUI-based MacPerl programs would run on both platforms.
This may happen in the future.  There is a separate
<a href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=macosx">mailing list</a>
for perl on Mac OS X.
</p>


<h2>perl 6</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/">perl 6</a> is a complete rewrite of perl,
currently under development.  There are no specific plans to port it to
Mac OS.  When perl 6 gets moving more, and there's an alpha etc.,
maybe there will be.
