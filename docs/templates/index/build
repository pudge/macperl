<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>
All the software required to build MacPerl is available for free.
</p>

<p>
To build MacPerl, you will need a Mac and plenty of RAM.  The build goes
fine with a PowerBook G3/400 with 256MB, and on a iBook 333 with 128MB RAM.
</p>

<p>
You will also need a working knowledge of Mac OS and MPW,
the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop.  If you don't know MPW,
you can mostly pick it up along the way if you have any familiarity
with command lines.
</p>

<p>
For now, the x2p translators cannot be built
with an SC/MrC-only build, and there is no CFM68K support.
</p>

<p>
If you have already built MacPerl 5.6.x before, you can probably
just download the perl and MacPerl source kits and take it from there.
You should upgrade GUSI if it has changed since your last build.
<b>Note:</b> if you don't already have it, you will need to
upgrade your db library to
<a href="http://dev.macperl.org/files/macperl_build_libs/db_185h.sit.bin">db_185h</a>
and your XML to
<a href="http://dev.macperl.org/files/macperl_build_libs/XL_16.bin">XL_16</a>
for MacPerl 5.6.1b1 (or re-fetch all of the
<a href="http://dev.macperl.org/files/macperl_build_libs.sit.bin">macperl_build_libs</a>
archive).
</p>

<h2><a name="ingredients">Ingredients</a></h2>

<p>
Some version numbers are noted.  These are the minimum
recommended versions for building with.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/">Stuffit Expander</a>
is the recommended way to unpack the files below.  It should
handle the .sit, .tar.gz, and any other files necessary for
this build.  However, you should consider selecting
the "Convert text files to Macintosh format ... When a file is
known to contain text" option, so the STLport archive
will be properly unpacked.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://dev.macperl.org/files/macperl_build_libs.sit.bin">macperl_build_libs.sit</a></strong>,
		a collection of freely available libraries and
		tools for building MacPerl.  It includes dmake,
		patch, sfio, XL, AEGizmos, MoreFiles, and
		Internet Config.  Each of these packages is also
		<a href="http://dev.macperl.org/files/macperl_build_libs/">available separately</a>.
		However, there are some aliases in the main distribution
		set up especially for the build, so if you get the
		individual packages you might have some broken paths.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7941&amp;release_id=44793">GUSI 2</a></strong>
		(GUSI_219 or later; get the Pro5 libs in addition if using CodeWarrior
		Pro 5)</li>

	<li><strong><a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/">MPW</a></strong>,
		the complete installation from Apple (I got the single image of
		MPW-GM)</li>

	<li><strong><a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/">Metrowerks</a>
		CodeWarrior compilers for MPW</strong> (Pro 5 recommended; MWC68K 2.3.2 build 79, MWCPPC 2.3.2 build 75) 
		<em>or</em> of the <strong>MPW C/C++ compilers</strong>
		(SC 8.8.4f1, MrC 4.1.0f1c1)
		<sup><a href="#" onmouseover="return set_status(0);" onclick="return no_click(0);">0</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li><strong><a href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7940&amp;release_id=20742">MacPerl and the perl MPW tool</a></strong>
		(the current releases; perl itself is used for part of the build)</li>

	<li><strong><a href="http://www.stlport.org/">STLport</a></strong> (3.12.3), if building with SC / MrC
		<sup><a href="#" onmouseover="return set_status(1);" onclick="return no_click(1);">1</a></sup>
	</li>

	<li>

	</li>
</ul>



<h2><a name="recipe">Recipe</a></h2>

<ol>
	<li><p>Unpack the macperl_build_libs.sit archive, which will create
		a folder called "macperl_src".  Put it in a location such
		that the path to the directory has no whitespace or odd
		characters in it.  So "HD:macperl_src:" is fine (and is
		what I will be using for the directions below), but
		"Macintosh HD:macperl_src:" is not.  Yes, you may need to
		change your hard drive's name.  Sorry.  :-)
		This will be your main build folder.</p></li>

	<li><p>Unpack and install MPW.  The easiest way to do this is to get
		the single MPW-GM image from Apple's site, mount the image,
		and drag the folder in the image to your drive.  It can
		be anywhere on your system, but you may wish to keep it
		in "HD:macperl_src:" for convenience.</p></li>

	<li><p>Copy the dmake tool, and the startup.mk file from
		the dmake distribution, and the patch tool from the gPatch
		distribution, to the MPW <em>Tools</em> folder.
		Copy the BuildProgram and BuildCommands scripts from
		the dmake folder to the MPW <em>Scripts</em> folder,
		overwriting the existing scripts of the same name
		(backup the old ones if you want to).</p></li>

	<li><p>Unpack the GUSI distribution.  If using CodeWarrior Pro 5,
		also unpack the Pro5 archive, and replace the existing GUSI
		libraries with the ones in the Pro5 distribution.  If using SC/MrC,
		unpack the STLport distribution into the same location as where
		the GUSI distribution is unpacked, so each folder is
		within the same enclosing folder.  They can
		be anywhere on your system, but you may wish to keep them
		in "HD:macperl_src:" for convenience.</p></li>

	<li><p>Give the <em>MPW Shell</em> application plenty of RAM (I
		gave it 30MB) and make sure you have plenty of extra RAM
		while the app is running (another 30MB might be sufficient).
		<sup><a href="#" onmouseover="return set_status(3);" onclick="return no_click(3);">3</a></sup>
		Then run the application.  If you wish, create a new document to
		work in.</p></li>

	<li><p>Change directory (using the "directory" command) in MPW to the
		GUSI directory, and run the <em>GUSI_Install.MPW</em> script.
		<sup><a href="#" onmouseover="return set_status(4);" onclick="return no_click(4);">4</a></sup></p><pre>
			directory "HD:macperl_src:GUSI_219:"
			GUSI_Install.MPW</pre>
		
		<p>If using STLport (SC/MrC builds), also run the
		<em>STLport_Install.MPW</em> script here.</p></li>

	<li><p>Change directory to the "HD:macperl_src:Sfio_04Aug99:", and execute the
		<em>Sfio_Install.MPW</em> script.</p></li>

	<li><p>If using the Metrowerks compilers, execute the
		<em>CW_Max_NoDup_Update</em> script.</p></li>

	<li><p>If not already installed, install MacPerl, and the perl MPW tool.
		The main MacPerl distribution must be installed for
		the perl MPW tool to have access to the Perl library.
		To install the perl MPW tool, see the documentation that
		comes with it.</p></li>

	<li><p>Unpack the MacPerl source kit.  Put the "macperl" and "perl"
		folders inside "HD:macperl_src:".</p></li>

	<li><p>Open "HD:macperl_src:perl:macos:MacPerlConfig.mk" and
		change the preferences there for the compilers you will
		be using.  (CodeWarrior is 68K/PPC, Apple is SC/MrC.)
		You MUST use BOTH 68K and PPC, or SC and MrC.  Do not
		try to build with only one compiler; pick one pair,
		or both pairs.</p></li>

	<li><p>Quit and restart MPW Shell, so the startup files will
		be executed, or execute the MPW startup files
		manually.</p></li>

	<li><p>Change directory in MPW to "HD:macperl_src:perl:macos:" and
		execute <tt>buildprogram all</tt>.  This could take up
		to an hour, and will build all of the MPW tools
		and perl modules for the compilers you chose.</p></li>

	<li><p>Change directory in MPW to "HD:macperl_src:macperl:" and
		execute <tt>buildprogram all</tt>.  This will build
		the MacPerl application and supporting files.</p></li>

	<li><p>Do a happy dance.  You're done.  Note that there are
		plenty of bugs, so some things will not work.  Set
		your library path to "HD:macperl_src:perl:lib:" and
		you should have access to the standard perl
		and MacPerl library.  Note that the standard perl
		library is currently only installed as static libraries,
		while the MacPerl modules are installed as dynamic
		libraries (for PPC/MrC only).</p></li>

	<li><p>If you wish, move on to do some
		<a href="http://dev.macperl.org/cgi-bin/mp-report">testing</a>.</p></li>
