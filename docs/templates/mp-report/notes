This is a place to report successful builds and uses of the development
version of MacPerl, and to report test results of the various tests in
the perl test suite.
</p>

<p>
The first thing you should do is register as a user.  Please use the same
user name as your SourceForge user name.
</p>

<p>
After that, you can register various configurations that you have either
built MacPerl on, or used MacPerl on.  Note the processor type, RAM,
compilers used, etc.
</p>

<p>
Then you can start testing, and reporting the results.

Any bugs you run
into, please check out the
<a href="http://sf.net/tracker/?group_id=7940&amp;atid=107940">bug
reporting</a> page, and to submit patches, please use the
<a href="http://sf.net/tracker/?group_id=7940&amp;atid=307940">patches</a>
page.  This here is for reporting results, but bugs and patches -- for
MacPerl itself or this page -- should go over there.

<p>
Thanks for your help!
