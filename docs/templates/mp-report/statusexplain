<li>"OK" means nothing needs to be done to the test to make it work.</li>
<li>"Some porting needed" means the test just needs a few changes to make it work
with MacPerl, but that MacPerl itself is fine, and a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=7940&amp;atid=307940">patch
should be submitted</a> (but don't do it if you can't, don't want to, don't have time
etc., as long as you describe the problem well).</li>
<li>"Major porting needed" means that either MacPerl needs to be fixed, or
the test needs major rewriting.  If MacPerl needs to be fixed, a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=7940&amp;atid=107940">bug
report should be submitted</a>.</li>
